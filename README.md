# Nuxt WebContainers

## Project Status: Experimental and Incomplete

**Note:** This project is currently in an experimental stage and is not considered complete. Feel free to explore, but be aware that features and functionality might be incomplete.

## What's This?

Nuxt WebContainers is a project designed to leverage the capabilities of [webcontainers](https://webcontainers.io/), enabling the execution of Node.js applications directly within a web browser environment. This project allows users to run public GitHub repositories or even log in to their GitHub accounts to test and execute private repositories, all without the need to download the codebase to their local machines.

## Key Features

- **Browser-based Execution:** Utilize the power of webcontainers.io to run Node.js applications directly in your web browser.

- **GitHub Integration:** Easily load public GitHub repositories or log in to your GitHub account to access and test private repositories.

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** Explore an integrated environment with a code editor, file explorer, and an output display for your app's results.

- **Lazy Testing:** Skip the hassle of downloading GitHub repos to your PC â€“ test them on the fly!
