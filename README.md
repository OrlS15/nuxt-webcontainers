- **GitHub Integration:** Easily load public GitHub repositories or log in to your GitHub account to access and test private repositories.

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** Explore an integrated environment with a code editor, file explorer, and an output display for your app's results.

- **Lazy Testing:** Skip the hassle of downloading GitHub repos to your PC â€“ test them on the fly!
